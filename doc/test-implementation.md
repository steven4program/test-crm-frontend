# Testing Implementation Plan for CRM Frontend

## Overview

Comprehensive testing strategy for React 18 + TypeScript + Vite CRM application covering unit, integration, and e2e testing.

## Stage 1: Unit Testing Foundation (Week 1)

### Setup Testing Framework

- Install Vitest (Vite-native testing framework)
- Install React Testing Library + Jest DOM
- Configure test environment and TypeScript support
- Setup test coverage reporting

### Priority Test Coverage

- Services layer (api.ts, auth.ts, customers.ts, users.ts)
- React hooks (useAuth)
- Utility functions and API error handling
- Context providers (AuthProvider)

## Stage 2: Component Testing (Week 2)

### Component Unit Tests

- LoginPage component (forms, validation, error states)
- Layout component (navigation, user display)
- Route guards (PrivateRoute, AdminRoute)
- Form components and interactive elements

### Testing Patterns

- Mock API calls with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Test user interactions and state changes
- Accessibility testing with @testing-library/jest-dom

## Stage 3: Integration Testing (Week 3)

### API Integration Tests

- Authentication flow end-to-end
- CRUD operations for users/customers
- Error handling and token management
- Role-based access control

### Component Integration

- AuthProvider + LoginPage integration
- Protected routes with authentication
- Navigation and routing flows

## Stage 4: E2E Testing Setup (Week 4)

### Playwright Installation

- Setup Playwright for cross-browser testing
- Configure test environments (local/staging)
- Setup CI/CD integration

### Critical User Journeys

- Login/logout flow
- Dashboard navigation
- User management (admin only)
- Customer CRUD operations
- Error scenarios and edge cases

## Dependencies to Install

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^1.0.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.0.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.0.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
    "msw": "^2.0.0",
    "@playwright/test": "^1.40.0",
    "jsdom": "^23.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Core testing setup + services tests
2. **Week 2**: Component tests + authentication tests
3. **Week 3**: Integration tests + API mocking
4. **Week 4**: E2E tests + CI/CD integration

## Success Metrics

- 80%+ code coverage for critical paths
- All authentication flows tested
- Admin/user role separation verified
- Cross-browser e2e test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
